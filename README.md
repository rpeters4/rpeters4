# Hi there, I'm Ryan Peters 👋

I'm a software developer with a strong focus on data science and formal methods. I love working with various programming languages and frameworks to solve complex problems.

My research interests include political topology/topography datasets and anaylizing their features to promote a more engaged voter base in the United States.

I have secondary interests with game development and am always adding dev manuals for coding/inspiration projects I'm currently working on. 

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Languages**: Python, C++, C#, Racket, Swift
- **Data Science Frameworks**: pandas, Polars, numpy
- **Formal Methods**: TLA+
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, Xcode, Unity

## 📊 Data Science
I have extensive experience working with data science frameworks like **pandas** and **Polars**. These tools help me efficiently manipulate and analyze large datasets, enabling data-driven decision-making and insightful visualizations.

## 🔍 Formal Methods with TLA+
I also work with **TLA+**, a formal specification language used to design, model, document, and verify concurrent systems and algorithms. TLA+ helps ensure the correctness of complex systems by allowing precise descriptions of system behaviors and properties, which can be rigorously checked for logical consistency.
